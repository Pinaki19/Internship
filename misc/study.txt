Let me explain the medical sentiment keywords and their weightages:

These keywords are specifically chosen for medical context sentiment analysis because:

Clinical Relevance:
Positive indicators like 'improved', 'resolved', 'well-controlled' represent positive clinical outcomes
Negative indicators like 'worsened', 'deteriorating', 'infection' represent adverse clinical outcomes
Weightage Scale:
Positive weightages range from 0.5 to 1.0
Negative weightages range from -0.6 to -1.0
The weightages are calculated based on:

Clinical Severity:
Maximum weights (±1.0) for definitive terms like 'improved'(1.0), 'worsened'(-1.0), 'resolved'(1.0), 'suicidal'(-1.0)
Medium weights (±0.8) for significant changes like 'decreased'(0.8), 'increased pain'(-0.8)
Lower weights (±0.5-0.7) for mild/stable conditions like 'stable'(0.5), 'normal'(0.5)
Temporal Context:
Terms indicating sustained change get higher weights (e.g., 'well-controlled': 0.9)
Terms indicating temporary states get lower weights (e.g., 'interfering': -0.7)
These weightages are then combined with either VADER or TextBlob scores using the optimal weights found through grid search (medical_weight: 0.39 for TextBlob, 0.61 for VADER) to produce the final sentiment score.
